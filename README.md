This repository documents the design, development, and testing of our **Electric All-Terrain Vehicle (E-ATV)** built for the **SAE INDIA BAJA 2024 competition**.  
Our primary objective was to **replace the traditional internal combustion engine with a reliable electric powertrain**, ensuring that the vehicle has sufficient **power, torque, and speed** for off-road conditions while prioritizing **driver safety, handling, and endurance**.

## Project Overview

- **Competition**: SAE INDIA E-BAJA 2024  
- **Team Role Highlight**:  
  - **Steering Head:** – responsible for the **design and manufacturing of the Rack & Pinion steering system**  
  - Developed a **4:1 Steering Ratio Rack & Pinion** mechanism ensuring precise control and optimized steering geometry.  
  - Worked on achieving the right **Ackermann geometry (63%)** and **inner steering angle of 60°** to improve maneuverability in tight courses.  
- **Focus Areas:** Suspension tuning, steering geometry, braking performance, and overall vehicle dynamics.
