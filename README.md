# Electric-ATV-for-SAE-INDIA-COMPETITION-2024

This repository documents the design, development, and testing of our **Electric All-Terrain Vehicle (E-ATV)** built for the **SAE INDIA BAJA 2024 competition**.  
Our primary objective was to **replace the traditional internal combustion engine with a reliable electric powertrain**, ensuring that the vehicle has sufficient **power, torque, and speed** for off-road conditions while prioritizing **driver safety, handling, and endurance**.

## Project Overview

- **Competition**: SAE INDIA E-BAJA 2024  
- **Team Role Highlight**:  
  - **Steering Head:** – responsible for the **design and manufacturing of the Rack & Pinion steering system**  
  - Developed a **4:1 Steering Ratio Rack & Pinion** mechanism ensuring precise control and optimized steering geometry.  
  - Worked on achieving the right **Ackermann geometry (63%)** and **inner steering angle of 60°** to improve maneuverability in tight courses.  
- **Focus Areas:** Suspension tuning, steering geometry, braking performance, and overall vehicle dynamics.

## Responsibilities & Learnings

- Designed, validated, and iterated **Rack & Pinion Steering** system with optimal steering ratio for agility and driver comfort.
- Integrated steering geometry with suspension to reduce **understeer** and improve cornering stability.
- Collaborated with the team to ensure correct **load transfer**, **ackermann percentage**, and **tie-rod length**.
- Hands-on experience in **SolidWorks, simulation, and real-world testing** of steering systems.
